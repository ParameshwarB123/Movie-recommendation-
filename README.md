EDA & K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification/regression.
The goal is to explore the dataset, extract insights through visualization, and build a predictive model using KNN.
